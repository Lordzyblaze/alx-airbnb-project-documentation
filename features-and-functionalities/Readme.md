Project Requirements for the Airbnb Clone Backend

üìö Introduction to Project Requirements
Backend development involves creating the server-side logic, database management, and API integrations that power a web application. In this concept page, we will focus on the backend requirements for the Airbnb Clone project, emphasizing the key features that make the app functional, user-friendly, and efficient.

The requirements outlined below are categorized into Core Functionalities, Technical Requirements, and Non-Functional Requirements.

üîë Core Functionalities
The backend for the Airbnb Clone must enable key features that align with the functionalities of a rental marketplace.

1. User Management
User Registration:
Allow users to sign up as guests or hosts.
Use secure authentication methods like JWT (JSON Web Tokens).
User Login and Authentication:
Implement login via email and password.
Include OAuth options (e.g., Google, Facebook).
Profile Management:
Enable users to update their profiles, including profile photos, contact info, and preferences.

2. Property Listings Management
Add Listings:
Hosts can create property listings by providing details such as title, description, location, price, amenities, and availability.
Edit/Delete Listings:
Hosts can update or remove their property listings.

3. Booking Management
Booking Creation:
Guests can book a property for specified dates.
Prevent double bookings using date validation.
Booking Cancellation:
Allow guests or hosts to cancel bookings based on the cancellation policy.
Booking Status:
Track booking statuses such as pending, confirmed, canceled, or completed.

4. Payment Integration
Implement secure payment gateways (e.g., Stripe, PayPal) to handle:
Upfront payments by guests.
Automatic payouts to hosts after a booking is completed.
Include support for multiple currencies.

üõ†Ô∏è Technical Requirements
1. Database Management
Use a relational database such as PostgreSQL or MySQL.
Required tables:
Users (guests and hosts)
Properties
Bookings
Reviews
Payments

2. Authentication and Authorization
Use JWT for secure user sessions.
Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to differentiate permissions between:
Guests
Hosts
Admins
3. File Storage (Scenario based)
Store property images and user profile photos in cloud storage solutions such as AWS S3 or Cloudinary. For implementation, we will use file storage
4. Third-Party Services
Use email services like SendGrid or Mailgun for email notifications.
